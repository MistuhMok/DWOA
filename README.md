# Find Upcoming Elections

This project uses 'https://api.turbovote.org/elections/upcoming' to search for upcoming elections in your area. A form will load on the home page where individuals can enter their address and then find elections near them. The results from the search will display immediately underneath the form.

## How to install and run

1. In the project directory, install the node modules. I use yarn but all commands can be replaced with npm as well.
   `yarn install`

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode after the modules have been installed.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
